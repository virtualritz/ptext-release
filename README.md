pText is a library for creating and manipulating PDF files in python.

## 0. About pText

pText is a pure python library to read, write and manipulate PDF documents. It represents a PDF document as a JSON-like datastructure of nested lists, dictionaries and primitives (numbers, string, booleans, etc)

This is currently a one-man project, so the focus will always be to support those use-cases that are more common in favor of those that are rare.

## 1. About the Examples

Most examples double as tests, you can find them in the 'tests' directory.  
They include; 
- reading a PDF and extracting meta-information
- changing meta-information  
- extracting text from a PDF
- extracting images from a PDF
- changing images in a PDF
- adding annotations (notes, links, etc) to a PDF
- adding text to a PDF
- adding tables to a PDF
- adding lists to a PDF
- using a layout
 and much more
 
### 1.1 Hello World

To give you an immediate idea of the way `pText` works, this is the classic `Hello World` example, in `pText`:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from ptext.pdf.canvas.layout.page_layout.multi_column_layout import SingleColumnLayout
from ptext.pdf.canvas.layout.text.paragraph import Paragraph
from ptext.pdf.document import Document
from ptext.pdf.page.page import Page
from ptext.pdf.pdf import PDF

# create an empty Document
pdf = Document()

# add an empty Page
page = Page()
pdf.append_page(page)

# use a PageLayout (SingleColumnLayout in this case)
layout = SingleColumnLayout(page)

# add a Paragraph object
layout.add(Paragraph("Hello World!"))

# store the PDF
with open(Path("output.pdf"), "wb") as pdf_file_handle:
    PDF.dumps(pdf_file_handle, pdf)
```
